# eBot-api
Rest api for eBot-CSGO database.

Rest api is read only and a subset of data from eBot database, meant for external partners to use
match data during or after tournaments.

Highly recommended to use read slave(mysql) for the api.
We used Amazon RDS, [read more how to set up RDS slave with onsite cluster](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/MySQL.Procedural.Importing.External.Repl.html)
